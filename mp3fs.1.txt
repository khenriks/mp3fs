NAME
----
mp3fs - mounts and transcodes FLACs and OGGs to MP3s on the fly


SYNOPSIS
--------
*mp3fs* ['OPTION']... 'IN_DIR' 'OUT_DIR'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The mp3fs(1) command will mount the directory 'IN_DIR' on 'OUT_DIR'.
Thereafter, accessing 'OUT_DIR' will show the contents of 'IN_DIR', with
all FLAC/Ogg Vorbis files transparently renamed and transcoded to MP3
format upon access.


OPTIONS
-------
*-b, -obitrate*='RATE'::
    Set the bitrate to use for encoding. Acceptable values for 'RATE' are
    any which are allowed by the MP3 format. According to the manual for
    LAME, this means:
+
For sampling frequencies of 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz, 'RATE' can be among 32,
40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, and 320.
+
For sampling frequencies of 16, 22.05, and 24 kHz, 'RATE' can be among 8,
16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, and 160.
+
When in doubt, it is recommended to choose a bitrate among 96, 112, 128,
160, 192, 224, 256, and 320. If not specified, 'RATE' defaults to 128.

*-d, -odebug*::
    Enable debug output. This will result in a large quantity of
    diagnostic information being printed to stderr as the program runs.
    This option will normally not be used. It implies *-f*.

*--gainmode, -ogainmode*='MODE'::
    Set mode to use for interpreting ReplayGain tags. The allowed
    values for 'MODE' are: +
    0 - Ignore all ReplayGain tags. +
    1 - Prefer album gain tag, but fall back to track gain if album gain
        is not present. +
    2 - Use track gain if present. +

*--gainref, -ogainref*='REF'::
    Set the reference loudness in decibels to adjust ReplayGain tags.
    ReplayGain software usually defaults to a loudness of 89 dB, but if
    this is too quiet, a higher value can be set here, causing adjustment
    of ReplayGain values in tags.

*-f*::
    Run in foreground instead of detaching from the terminal.

*-h, --help*::
    Print usage information.

*--quality, -oquality*='QUALITY'::
    Set quality for encoding, as understood by LAME. The slowest and best
    quality is 0, while 9 is the fastest and worst quality. The default
    value is 5, although according to the LAME manual, 2 is recommended.

*-s*::
    Force single-threaded operation.

*-V, --version*::
    Output version information.
