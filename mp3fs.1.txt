NAME
----
mp3fs - mounts and transcodes FLACs to MP3s on the fly


SYNOPSIS
--------
*mp3fs* ['OPTION']... 'FLACDIR' 'MP3DIR'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The mp3fs(1) command will mount the directory 'FLACDIR' on 'MP3DIR'.
Thereafter, accessing 'MP3DIR' will show the contents of 'FLACDIR', with
all FLAC files transparently renamed and transcoded to MP3 format upon
access.


OPTIONS
-------
*-b, -obitrate*='RATE'::
    Set the bitrate to use for encoding. Acceptable values for 'RATE' are
    any which are allowed by the MP3 format. According to the manual for
    LAME, this means:
+
For sampling frequencies of 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz, 'RATE' can be among 32,
40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, and 320.
+
For sampling frequencies of 16, 22.05, and 24 kHz, 'RATE' can be among 8,
16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, and 160.
+
When in doubt, it is recommended to choose a bitrate among 96, 112, 128,
160, 192, 224, 256, and 320. If not specified, 'RATE' defaults to 128.

*-v, -ovbr*::
    Enable variable bit rate encoding.  Disabled by default.

*-d, -odebug*::
    Enable debug output. This will result in a large quantity of
    diagnostic information being printed to stderr as the program runs.
    This option will normally not be used. It implies *-f*.

*--gainmode, -ogainmode*='MODE'::
    Set mode to use for interpreting ReplayGain tags. The allowed
    values for 'MODE' are: +
    0 - Ignore all ReplayGain tags. +
    1 - Prefer album gain tag, but fall back to track gain if album gain
        is not present. +
    2 - Use track gain if present. +

*--gainref, -ogainref*='REF'::
    Set the reference loudness in decibels to adjust ReplayGain tags.
    ReplayGain software usually defaults to a loudness of 89 dB, but if
    this is too quiet, a higher value can be set here, causing adjustment
    of ReplayGain values in tags.

*-f*::
    Run in foreground instead of detaching from the terminal.

*-h, --help*::
    Print usage information.

*--quality, -oquality*='QUALITY'::
    Set quality for encoding, as understood by LAME. The slowest and best
    quality is 0, while 9 is the fastest and worst quality. The default
    value is 5, although according to the LAME manual, 2 is recommended.

*-s*::
    Force single-threaded operation.

*-V, --version*::
    Output version information.
