We're pleased to announce the release of version 0.32 of mp3fs! This is a
bugfix release that addresses many small bugs.

Introduction
------------

MP3FS is a read-only FUSE filesystem which transcodes audio formats
(currently FLAC) to MP3 on the fly when opened and read. This was
written to enable me to use my FLAC collection with software and/or
hardware which only understands the MP3 format e.g. gmediaserver to a
Netgear MP101 MP3 player.

It is also a novel alternative to traditional MP3 encoders. Just use your
favorite file browser to select the files you want encoded and copy them
somewhere!

How it Works
------------

When a file is opened, the decoder and encoder are initialised and
the file metadata is read. At this time the final filesize can be
determined as we only support constant bitrate (CBR) MP3 files.

As the file is read, it is transcoded into an internal per-file
buffer. This buffer continues to grow while the file is being read
until the whole file is transcoded in memory. The memory is freed
only when the file is closed. This simplifies the implementation.

Seeking within a file will cause the file to be transcoded up to the
seek point (if not already done). This is not usually a problem
since most programs will read a file from start to finish. Future
enhancements may provide true random seeking.

ID3 version 2.4 and 1.1 tags are created from the vorbis comments in
the FLAC file. They are located at the start and end of the file
respectively.

A special optimisation is made so that applicatins which scan for
id3v1 tags do not have to wait for the whole file to be transcoded
before reading the tag. This *dramatically* speeds up such
applications.

For build instructions see the bundled INSTALL file.

Usage
-----

**NOTE:** The command line format changed in version 0.30, making bitrate
a command-line or mount option of the program.

Mount your filesystem like this::

  mp3fs [-b bitrate] musicdir mountpoint [-o fuse_options]

For example,

::

  mp3fs -b 128 /mnt/music /mnt/mp3 -o allow_other,ro

In recent versions of FUSE and mp3fs, the same can be achieved with the
following entry in ``/etc/fstab``::

  mp3fs#/mnt/music /mnt/mp3 fuse allow_other,ro,bitrate=128 0 0

Note that this requires /sbin/mount.fuse from the fuse-utils package.

At this point the filesystem is ready to be used. Here are the original
files::

  -rw-r--r-- 1 mythtv mythtv 11432008 2005-06-19 18:36 14 - Spaced.flac

And now you can use the (virtual) MP3 files from the mp3fs mountpoint::

Download
--------

Releases are made through our website on GitHub.

There are now two different branches of mp3fs development:

- Active development will occur on the main branch, which has version
  numbers 0.20 or higher. FLAC version 1.1.4 or higher is
  required.
- Only bug fixes will happen on the legacy branch, which has version
  numbers less than 0.20. Any version of FLAC is supported.

The reason for two branches is to maintain compatibility with old versions
of FLAC. This is necessary because a major Linux vendor provides only an
ancient version of FLAC in several of their releases.

The bottom line is that if you have a suitable version of FLAC, you should
use the very latest version of mp3fs. If not, you can use a version from
the legacy branch.

Development
-----------

MP3FS uses Git for revision control. You can obtain the full repository
with::

  git clone git://github.com/khenriks/mp3fs.git

MP3FS is written in C and uses the following libraries:

- `FUSE <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/>`_ (>= 2.6.0)
- `FLAC <http://flac.sourceforge.net/>`_ (>= 1.1.4 unless using mp3fs <0.20)
- `LAME <http://lame.sourceforge.net/>`_
- `libid3tag <http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/>`_
