NAME
----
ffmpegfs - mounts and transcodes a multitude of formats like FLACs or OGGs
to MP3s or MP4s on the fly


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ffmpegfs* ['OPTION']... 'IN_DIR' 'OUT_DIR'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The ffmpegfs(1) command will mount the directory 'IN_DIR' on 'OUT_DIR'.
Thereafter, accessing 'OUT_DIR' will show the contents of 'IN_DIR', with
all supported media files transparently renamed and transcoded to MP3/MP4
format upon access.


OPTIONS
-------

Usage: ffmpegfs [OPTION]... IN_DIR OUT_DIR

Mount IN_DIR on OUT_DIR, converting audio/video files to MP3/MP4 upon access.

Encoding options:

*--desttype*=TYPE, *-odesttype*=TYPE::
                           Select destination format. Can currently be
                           either mp3 or mp4. To stream videos, mp4 must be
                           selected.
                           Default: mp4

Audio Options:

*--audiobitrate*=RATE, *-o audiobitrate*=RATE::
                           Audio encoding bitrate (in kbit): Acceptable values for RATE
                           include 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, and
                           320.
                           Default: 128 kbit
*--audiosamplerate*=Hz, *-o audiosamplerate*=Hz::
                           Limits the output sample rate to Hz. If the source file
                           sample rate is more it will be downsampled automatically.
                           Typical values are 8000, 11025, 22050, 44100,
                           48000, 96000, 192000. Set to 0 to keep source rate.
                           Default: 44.1 kHz

Video Options:

*--videobitrate*=RATE, *-o videobitrate*=RATE::
                           Video encoding bit rate (in kbit). Acceptable values for RATE
                           range between 500 and 250000. Setting this too high or low may.
                           cause transcoding to fail.
                           Default: 2 Mbit
+
Acceptable values for 'RATE':
+
*MP4 audio:*
+    
8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 224, 
256, 288, 320, 352, 384, 416 and 448.
+    
*MP4 video*
+    
500 - 25000 (kbit)
+    
*MP3 audio:*
+
For sampling frequencies of 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz, 'RATE' can be among 32,
40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, and 320.
+
For sampling frequencies of 16, 22.05, and 24 kHz, 'RATE' can be among 8,
16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, and 160.
+
When in doubt, it is recommended to choose a bitrate among 96, 112, 128,
160, 192, 224, 256, and 320. If not specified, 'RATE' defaults to 128.

Cache Options:

 *--expiry_time*=SECONDS, *-o expiry_time*=SECONDS::
                           Cache entries expire after SECONDS and will be deleted
                           to save disk space.
                           Default: 1 week
 *--max_inactive_suspend*=SECONDS, *-o max_inactive_suspend*=SECONDS::
                           While being accessed the file is transcoded to the target format
                           in the background. When the client quits transcoding will continue
                           until this time out. Transcoding is suspended until it is
                           accessed again, and transcoding will continue.
                           Default: 2 minutes
 *--max_inactive_abort*=SECONDS, *-o max_inactive_abort*=SECONDS::
                           While being accessed the file is transcoded to the target format
                           in the background. When the client quits transcoding will continue
                           until this time out, and the transcoder thread quits
                           Default: 5 minutes
 *--max_cache_size*=BYTES, *-o max_cache_size*=BYTES::
                           Set the maximum diskspace used by the cache. If the cache would grow
                           beyond this limit when a file is transcoded, old entries will be deleted
                           to keep the cache within the size limit.
                           Default: unlimited
 *--min_diskspace*=BYTES, *-o min_diskspace*=BYTES::
                           Set the required diskspace on the cachepath mount. If the remaining
                           space would fall below BYTES when a file is transcoded, old entries will
                           be deleted to keep the diskspace within the limit.
                           Default: 0 (no minimum space)
 *--cachepath*=DIR, *-o cachepath*=DIR::
                           Sets the disk cache directory to DIR. Will be created if not existing.
                           The user running ffmpegfs must have write access to the location.
                           Default: temp directory, e.g. /tmp
 *--disable_cache*, -o *disable_cache::
                           Disable the cache functionality.
                           Default: enabled

Logging:

*--log_maxlevel*=LEVEL, *-o log_maxlevel*=LEVEL::
                           Maximum level of messages to log, either ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
                           or TRACE. Defaults to WARNING, and always set to DEBUG in debug mode.
                           Note that the other log flags must also be set to enable logging.
*--log_stderr*, *-o log_stderr*::
                           Enable outputting logging messages to stderr.
                           Enabled in debug mode.
*--log_syslog*, *-o log_syslog*::
                           Enable outputting logging messages to syslog.
*--logfile*=FILE, *-o logfile*=FILE::
                           File to output log messages to. By default, no
                           file will be written.

General/FUSE options:

*-d*, *-o debug*::
    Enable debug output. This will result in a large quantity of
    diagnostic information being printed to stderr as the program runs.
    This option will normally not be used. It implies *-f*.

*-f*::
    Run in foreground instead of detaching from the terminal.

*-h*, *--help*::
    Print usage information.

*-V*, *--version*::
    Output version information.

*-s*::
    Force single-threaded operation.


Usage
-----

Mount your filesystem like this:

    ffmpegfs [--audiobitrate bitrate] [--videobitrate bitrate] musicdir mountpoint [-o fuse_options]

For example,

    ffmpegfs --audiobitrate 256 -videobitrate 2000000 /mnt/music /mnt/ffmpegfs -o allow_other,ro

In recent versions of FUSE and ffmpegfs, the same can be achieved with the
following entry in `/etc/fstab`:

    ffmpegfs#/mnt/music /mnt/ffmpegfs fuse allow_other,ro,audiobitrate=256,videobitrate=2000000 0 0

At this point files like `/mnt/music/**.flac` and `/mnt/music/**.ogg` will
show up as `/mnt/ffmpegfs/**.mp4`.

Note that the "allow_other" option by default can only be used by root.
You must either run ffmpegfs as root or better add a "user_allow_other" key
to /etc/fuse.conf.

"allow_other" is required to allow any user access to the mount, by
default this is only possible for the user who launched ffmpegfs.

HOW IT WORKS
------------

When a file is opened, the decoder and encoder are initialised and
the file metadata is read. At this time the final filesize can be
determined approximately. This works well for MP3 output files,
but only fair to good for MP4.

As the file is read, it is transcoded into an internal per-file
buffer. This buffer continues to grow while the file is being read
until the whole file is transcoded in memory. Once decoded the 
file is kept in a disk buffer and can be accessed very fast.

Transcoding is done in an extra thread, so if other processes should
access the same file they will share the same transcoded data, saving
CPU time. If the first process abandons the file before its end,
transconding will continue for some time. If the file is accessed
again before the timeout, transcoding will go on, if not it stops 
and the chunk created so far discarded to save disk space.

Seeking within a file will cause the file to be transcoded up to the
seek point (if not already done). This is not usually a problem
since most programs will read a file from start to finish. Future
enhancements may provide true random seeking (But if this is feasible
is yet unclear due to restrictions to positioning inside compressed
streams).

MP3: ID3 version 2.4 and 1.1 tags are created from the comments in the 
source file. They are located at the start and end of the file 
respectively. 

MP4: Same applies to meta atoms in MP4 containers.

MP3 target only: A special optimisation is made so that applications 
which scan for id3v1 tags do not have to wait for the whole file to be 
transcoded before reading the tag. This *dramatically* speeds up such
applications.

SUPPORTED OUTPUT FORMATS
------------------------

A few words to the supported output formats which are MP3 and MP4 
currently. There is not much to say about the MP3 output as these 
are regular MP3 files with no strings attached. They should play 
well in any modern player.

The MP4 files created are special, though, as MP4 is not quite suited
for live streaming. Reason being that the start block of an MP4 
contains a field with the size of the compressed data section. Suffice
to say that this field cannot be filled in until the size is known,
which means compression must be completed first, a seek done to the
beginning, and the size atom updated.

Alas, for a continous live stream, that size will never be known or
for our transcoded files one would have to wait for the whole file
to be recoded. If that was not enough some important pieces of 
information are located at the end of the file, including meta tags
with artist, album, etc.

Subsequently many applications will go to the end of an MP4 to read
important information before going back to the head of the file and
start playing. This will break the whole transcode-on-demand idea
of ffmpegfs.

To get around the restriction several extensions have been developed,
one of which is called "faststart" that relocates the afformentioned
data from the end to the beginning of the MP4. Additonally, the size field 
can be left empty (0). isml (smooth live streaming) is another extension.

For direct to stream transcoding several new features in MP4 need to
be used (ISMV, faststart, separate_moof/empty_moov to name them) 
which are not implemented in older versions (or if available, not 
working properly). 

By default faststart files will be created with an empty size field so 
that the file can be started to be written out at once instead of 
decoding it as a whole before this is possible. That would mean it would 
take some time before playback can start.

The data part is divided into chunks of about 5 seconds length each, 
this allowing to fill in the size fields early enough.

As a draw back not all players support the format, or play back with 
strange side effects. VLC plays the file, but updates the time display 
every 5 seconds only. When streamed over HTML5 video tags, there will be no
total time shown, but that is OK, as it is yet unknown. The playback
cannot be positioned past the current playback position, only backwards.

But that's the price of starting playback, fast.

So there is a lot of work to be put into MP4 support, still.

The output format must be selectable for the desired audience, for
streaming or opening the files locally, for example.
